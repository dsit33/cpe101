# take the first string in the input file and create a 10 x 10 list using a for loop and list comprehension

# print out what the word search puzzle looks like

# put the remaining strings in a list that represents the words to be found

# for loop that will iterate through each word in the list of words to be found

	# call each check function, passing through the word we are currently looking at and puzzle

	# if any of them return something other than -1, print out a statement that says the word and where the beginnning index is located

	# if they all return -1 then print the word and say it couldn't be found
